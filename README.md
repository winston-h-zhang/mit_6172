# MIT 6.172 Performance Engineering Materials

This is me getting bored of USC classes, so I'm gonna try to do some of the homeworks and projects in MIT 6.172.
The material I'm using can be found on MIT Open Courseware [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/index.htm).
